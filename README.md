Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Enzo Silveira, currently studying software engineering at [instituto federal de educaÃ§Ã£o ciÃªncia e tecnologia de sÃ£o paulo - campus SÃ£o Carlos](https://portais.ifsp.edu.br/scl/).
I have studied computer engineering for two years before that.

I have worked with C/C++, Java, Assembly X85, Python, Godot engine.
I'm still pretty much an amateur, but improving.
